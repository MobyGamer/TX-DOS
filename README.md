# TX-DOS v1.25 and v2.0
TX-DOS is a modification of MS-DOS 1.x and 2.x towards the goal of making it smaller and faster for the sole purpose of executing programs.  Nonessential functions, such as support for printers and printing, serial consoles, etc. are removed to make DOS take up less space on diskette.

This repo was forked from the OSS release of MS-DOS 1.25 and 2.0, and contain my modifications.  No compatibility with the original MS-DOS repo is implied or maintained, and no patches/pull requests/merges will be requested of that repo.
